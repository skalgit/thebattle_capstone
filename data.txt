For this project, we are going to use different data sources and providers.
For example, to get all capital cities in Europe, you can download data from this website: 
https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/capitals_europe.htm.
To get all trends, restaurant, bars etc we are using Foursquare that provides us almost all informations we need. 
Finally, to get the cost of living info, we are using another data source website: 
https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index/europe
